# How to Use This Code

This is a docker container that runs an image that contains a streamlit app. This app takes simple input data and makes a prediction based on that data for the survival likelihood of an individual on the Titanic. In order to run this code, you must download the folder onto your local machine, (you have to have Docker installed too!) then cd into that folder in anaconda prompt, from there you run the following commands "docker build -t titanic:streamlit_app ." (don't forget the trailing period!, once your image is built then you want to run it inside of a container with the following command "docker run -p 8501:8501 titanic:streamlit_app" and then launch your container in a web browser using the Docker Desktop app. That should take you to the app in your browser and you can use the app there!
