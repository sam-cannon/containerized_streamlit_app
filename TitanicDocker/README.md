# How to Use This Code

This is a simple deployed web app with a classification model for the Titanic dataset. The purpose of this code is to help people understand on a basic level how you can deploy ml models to web apps with streamlit. Download all of these files if you want to see the app and use it, cd into your directory where you stored these files, then open up your command line or anaconda prompt and use the command (without the quotes) 'streamlit run app.py' and you will see the app begin to run in the terminal. Copy and paste the URL into your web browser to use the app. This is essentially a template that I think can be really useful to amend based on your particular needs, its a good starting point for several basic web apps with ml models.
